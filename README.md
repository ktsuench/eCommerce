# eCommerce
This is a project for _COE528_ - _Object_ _Oriented_ _Engineering_ _Analysis_ _and_ _Design_.

We will be using NetBeans IDE to build this project along with Violet UML Editor to build the UML diagrams. As well, we will be using Github to sync everyone's work together. Refer to the project tab for tasks and requirements for the project.

To get started, clone this repo in NetBeans by going to __Team>Git>Clone__ and copy and paste https://github.com/ktsuench/eCommerce.git into the Repository URL field. Finish the cloning of the repo and start contributing to the project.

This will be the same as the labs, however the difference here is that we will be collaborating together to complete a project. To make things easier, each of us will be working on different classes so that we won't overwrite each other's code.

To update Github with your local modifications, go to the file that you want to add to the remote repository. Then go to __Team>Add__ and then __Team>Commit__. Fill in the commit message and then go to __Team>Remote>Pull__ to update your local repository before you update the remote one. After go to __Team>Remote>Push__ to push your local modifications to the remote repository.
