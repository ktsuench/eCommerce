# eCommerce
This is a project for a Engineering Design course.

This project is a example of an eCommerce platform built in Java. The software is extensible as the foundation of the program is focused on managing sessions and tasks that go on in an eCommerce platform. The database and payment processors are independent of the platform itself. It is possible to implement different solutions depending on what is required to fulfill those tasks. User roles can also be created and added to the platform itself.

Note, this program requires Java SDK 1.8 and currently uses JavaFX (FXML) for the GUI. There is no payment processor implemented at the moment and as for the database, the program reads in data from XML files.
